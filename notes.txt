******Notes from Punit's Code Review of this app:
server file shouldn't do a lot of logic- only initialize things
good that app.use(/, routes) is only that- no new info

create a separate file for  floating middleware
in server, make middleware.js, kinda next to utils
	(the one that was written by not us, should have a name, so we'd know what it does when we move into its own file
could rename users.js to sessions.js
	user would be more about if I want to update my username or password or something???????
---using contacts in the index.js is a smell, but what would be better?

Bcrypt is a responsibility of the model- don't bcrypt.compare in the route, instead, create a function inside of model/users and then call it here.
Same with the signup post that encrypts it   user.generatePassword

move message inside of the individual routes (so not global- but why is that bad??)
	don't need the variable, just pass in the message to the render

the whole thing about !variable instead of variable === false

don't make a variable if it's only used once, just inline it

put authorization folder into src

he's gonna get back to us about how to get multiple views

Use singular names for db tables. User is a reserved word, so we can't use it. Come up with a different thing to name the table instead.

The starter code we got has a non-restful routing thing â€“ it did a get to '/:contact_id/delete' Instead:
method-override package lets you PUT and DELETE using a form
	a regular form only supports GET and POST


******Punit's review of Jonathan and Eugene's Auth App
https://github.com/jrpool/auth
.env.template    is the name for that file
./server/middleware(s?) is where to put a bunch of middleware
	findBySessionId is a good name for that function :-)
If using some hardcoded value like if(request.session.user) to see if there is an authenticated user, instead make a function and use its called value there


********Q's:
-what is the best way to be able to access folders within views? Currently, we have an array of places to look with all the folders
-How do you do this:
The conString should be sent into new (require('connect-pg-simple')(session))() like:
store: new pgSession({
  conString : 'pg://' + config.username + ':' + config.password + '@' + config.host + '/' + config.database
}),
(Instead, We're using a DATABASE_URL variable)



********ToDo:
-add user notifications for username already exists error in signup
-incorporate Punit's notes
